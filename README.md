Temperature conversion refers to the process of changing a temperature value from one unit of measurement to another. The most commonly used temperature scales are Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K). Each scale has its own reference points and is used in different regions and scientific contexts.

This project involves the development of a Temperature Conversion Tool that allows users to convert temperature values between different units: Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K). The main goal is to provide a simple, accurate, and user-friendly interface for understanding and applying temperature conversions in everyday and scientific contexts.




# ✨ 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀

• Input a temperature value in any one unit.
• Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
• Display real-time results as the user inputs values.
• Validate input to handle invalid or out-of-range values.
